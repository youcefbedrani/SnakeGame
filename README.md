🐍 Snake Game

This is a modern rendition of the classic Snake game, built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a global leaderboard, where players can compete to achieve the highest score and claim the number one spot.
🎮 Gameplay

In this game, you control a snake and navigate it to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls or your own tail. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.
🌟 Features

    Responsive Design: The game adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
    Leaderboard: Scores are saved and displayed on a global leaderboard. The top player is highlighted, making it clear who is currently leading.
    User Accounts: Players can log in or create an account to save their progress and see how they rank against others globally.
    Real-time Scoring: The score updates in real-time as you play, with your best score automatically submitted to the leaderboard.
